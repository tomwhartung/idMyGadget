## Introduction:

Once you have installed idMyGadget, as described in the
[device_detectors README.md file](https://github.com/tomwhartung/idMyGadget/blob/master/device_detectors/README.md),
follow these steps to install the PHP device detection script from [detectmobilebrowsers.com].

## Installation and Setup:

This is the easiest option to set up.

Visit http://detectmobilebrowsers.com and click on the PHP button to
download the latest version of the detectmobilebrowsers script



To verify that you have the database and data directory set up properly,
access the following file in your web browser:
[http://example.com/idMyGadget/Tera-Wurfl/wurfl-dbapi/admin/install.php](http://example.com/idMyGadget/Tera-Wurfl/wurfl-dbapi/admin/install.php)

For example, if you are setting this up on your localhost, go to
[http://localhost/idMyGadget/Tera-Wurfl/wurfl-dbapi/admin/install.php](http://localhost/idMyGadget/Tera-Wurfl/wurfl-dbapi/admin/install.php)

Note that there is a link to this file in the idMyGadget/index.html and
idMyGadget/index.php files.


Run the demos to see:
